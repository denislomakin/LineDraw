Line Draw
Collaborators: Shagun Bose, Wesley Lewis, Oleg Demus, Denis Lomakin

In this game, you are given a random shape. The goal of the game is to draw this shape using one continuous line, without repeating any
edges. You can start from any vertex, but not all starting vertices will produce a solution, so there is an undo and a reset feature. 
Higher levels introduce more vertices and more edges.

The graphs generated will be eulerian circuits or eulerian paths. Eulerian circuits have an even number of edges connected to each vertex,
and can be traversed using each edge only once, starting and ending at the same vertex. Eulerian paths have exactly two vertices with odd
degree, and so start and end at different vertices and use each edge only once. This way the level always has at least one solution.
